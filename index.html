        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Leo Coote, a second-year Computer Science student at Cardiff University. After my first year, I secured a summer internship through the university, working on the Down2Earth project, a global collaboration between researchers. During this internship, I helped develop a PyPi package for forecasting water hazards, and was later invited to continue contributing as a part-time employee. My primary interest lies in artificial intelligence, and I am currently developing an app that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to help users practice languages. In my spare time, I enjoy learning Japanese and reading books.</p>
