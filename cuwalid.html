        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The EU-funded <strong><a href="https://down2earthproject.org/" target="_blank">Down2Earth</a></strong> project has created CUWALID, a modelling system to support a range of decision makers to make informed decisions on evaluating and managing climate in the Horn of Africa drylands (HAD) where seasonal climatic hazards have a major impact on people's lives especially in rural communities.

        <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contributed to the development of a <strong><a href="https://test.pypi.org/project/CUWALID/" target="_blank">PyPi package</a></strong> for water hazard forecasting using large datasets.</li>
            <li>Wrote Python modules for data processing and handling.</li>
            <li>Planned and executed the code structure for package development.</li>
            <li>Developed forecasting algorithms for predicting water hazards.</li>
            <li>Informed on key decisions during the development.</li>
            <li>Ensured the package was efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.</li>
            <li>Managed the project's documentation for easy usability</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>
            I collaborated with researchers to refine the application’s performance, optimized data pipelines, fixed bugs, and efficiently structured code.

        <ul>
            <li>Python (PyPi Package Development)</li>
            <li>Data Processing with Pandas and NumPy</li>
            <li>Geospatial Data Libraries (e.g., GeoPandas)</li>
            <li>Sphinx (Python documentation generator)</li>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            One of the primary challenges was ensuring that the forecasting algorithms could handle vast amounts of data efficiently. The diverse sources of data—ranging from satellite imagery to local sensor readings—required a system capable of processing and integrating various formats in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            To overcome this, I worked on improving the data ingestion pipeline, enabling the system to handle larger datasets while maintaining high performance. We also incorporated techniques to reduce memory usage and computation time, making the system more scalable.

        <h2>Impact and Future Goals</h2>
        <p>
            The Down2Earth <a href="https://down2earthproject.org/assets/files/CUWALID_Model.pdf" target="_blank">CUWALID</a> project is being piloted in flood-prone regions, providing early warning systems for water-related hazards. Moving forward, the project aims to integrate more real-time data sources and refine the algorithms to improve accuracy and response times.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions to this project have given me valuable experience in AI, machine learning, and the real-world application of data science. As the project evolves, I look forward to staying involved and contributing to further advancements in this field.
